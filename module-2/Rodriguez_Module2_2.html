   <h2> Chapter 1: Introduction </h2>
    
	<p class="intro"> My name is Marlene and I was born and raised in California. I live in Southern 
		California my entire life. I have not moved around houses in many cities 
		and practically lived a majority of my life in one city.  </p>

	<p> I am a family of 4 siblings. I am a middle child who is the second to youngest. 
	  	My siblings and I are very much close in age so we can relate on many things. </p>

	<p> My hobbies seem to be everywhere due to the fact that I enjoy many different things. 
		A few hobbies I enjoy are running, reading, shooting guns, welding, and playing 
		instruments. Since there are so many things I enjoy I find that I cannot master 
		a hobby beyond a certain level because it is hard to focus on just one hobby, but 
		I do enjoy them all regardless. </p>

	<p> There is time I must put aside for school since I am working full-time and enrolled in
		classes at Bellevue University. I am enjoying learning the topics that are given
		though some material can be intimidating. <span class="sentence"> I hope to finish 
		and obtain my Bachelor's degree with Bellevue University.</span> </p>
